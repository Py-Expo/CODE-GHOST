1.README - RFID Card Reader Code

This code provides an example implementation of an RFID card reader using the MFRC522 library. It reads the unique identifier (UID) of a card and sends it to the serial monitor.

Requirements:

Arduino board (compatible with the SPI interface)
1.RFID module (MFRC522)
2.Arduino IDE
3.MFRC522 library

2.Setup:
Connect the RFID module to the Arduino board:

->Connect the SDA pin (SS_PIN) of the RFID module to digital pin 10 of the Arduino.
->Connect the RST pin (RST_PIN) of the RFID module to digital pin 9 of the Arduino.
->Connect the SDA pin of the RFID module to the Arduino's 3.3V pin.
->Connect the SCK, MOSI, and MISO pins of the RFID module to the corresponding pins on the Arduino board.
->Connect the GND pin of the RFID module to the Arduino's GND pin.
->Connect the RST pin of the RFID module to the Arduino's 3.3V pin.
->Install the MFRC522 library in the Arduino IDE:

3.Open the Arduino IDE.
->Go to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Manage Libraries".
->Search for "MFRC522" and click on the library.
->Click the "Install" button.
->Upload the code to the Arduino:

Connect the Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
1.Open the Arduino IDE.
2.Go to "File" -> "Open" and select the RFID card reader code.
3.Click the "Upload" button to upload the code to the Arduino board.
4.Open the serial monitor:

In the Arduino IDE, go to "Tools" -> "Serial Monitor".
Set the baud rate to 9600.
You should see the serial monitor displaying the message "Scan PICC to see UID...".

Introduction
The Employee Cafeteria Time Analysis script reads an input Excel file containing employee data and calculates various metrics related to their time spent in the cafeteria. It uses the Streamlit framework for creating an interactive web application and Plotly for visualizations.

Installation
To run the script, follow these steps:

1.Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
2.Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4.Install the required Python dependencies by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
------
1.Prepare an Excel file containing employee data, with columns for 'EMPLOYEE ID', 'Date', and 'Time'.
2.Run the script by executing the following command:
streamlit run employee_cafeteria_analysis.py
3.The script will launch a web application in your browser.
4.Click on the "Choose a XLSX or XLSM file" button to upload the Excel file.
5.The script will process the data and display various visualizations and metrics related to employee cafeteria time.
6.You can interact with the visualizations and explore the data using the controls provided by the web application.
